Find more for this custom connection component for VMWare Remote Console and CyberArk in the following URL: https://wp.me/pbTwYg-35
 
This connection component allows you to create a secured and isolated session to a single virtual machine within vCenter Server
using CyberArk. This is accomplished by using VMWare Remote Console on an AutoIt connection component for the PSM module. To 
select the virtual machine we would like to connect to, we will use its MoRef ID (check VMWare References section).

In this diagram (find it attached as .png file), Dwight connects to the Virtual Machines he desires and is authenticated against the vCenter using the
Logon Account credentials. He doesn't necessarily need to know the Logon Account password as we can uncheck the "Retrieve Password" permission for Dwight.

Collaboration is neededâ€¦

I would like to improve the script in different ways:

Adding any code that improves its efficiency.
Capable of authenticating against the target system.
Separately from this process, I am working on a PACLI script that checks whether MoID for X account has changed. This script would be run as a scheduled job.

... ideas are welcomed!
